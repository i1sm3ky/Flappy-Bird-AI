# Flappy Bird AI
Welcome to the GitHub repository of this project, which was created to gain hands-on experience with AI, specifically focusing on NEAT (NeuroEvolution Augmenting Topologies). Throughout the development process, I followed a short course to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the concepts involved.

The primary objective of this project was to develop an AI for the popular game Flappy Bird, employing NEAT to enhance its learning and decision-making capabilities. Through extensive training, an effective and efficient AI was created, capable of navigating the game's obstacles with ease. In theory, this AI has the potential to run indefinitely, showcasing its remarkable adaptability and survival skills.

The game was created using PyGame and the AI uses NEAT.

Thank you for your interest in this project. Feel free to explore the repository and experiment with different configurations to witness the power of AI in conquering the challenges of Flappy Bird!

## Steps to configure and run

**To start the game, follow these steps:**

1. Run the `main.py` file.

2. A game window will appear on your screen, where the AI will take control.

**Customizing the Generation:**

If you wish to configure the number of birds in each generation, you can do so by modifying the `pop_size` parameter under the `[NEAT]` section in the `Config.txt` file.
